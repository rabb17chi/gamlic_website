PART 2: WASD MOVEMENT INVESTIGATION
================================================================================

Overview:
WASD movement on a website can create an immersive, game-like experience that
aligns perfectly with a game development company's brand. This feature allows
users to navigate or interact with elements using keyboard controls instead of
(or in addition to) traditional mouse scrolling.

Use Cases for WASD Movement:

1. CHARACTER NAVIGATION
   - Move a character sprite around the page
   - Navigate between sections by moving to specific areas
   - Interactive exploration of game assets

2. CAMERA/CANVAS MOVEMENT
   - Pan around a large game world map
   - Explore detailed game environments
   - Navigate through a 2D game level showcase

3. SECTION NAVIGATION
   - Move between page sections using WASD
   - Smooth transitions between content areas
   - Alternative to scroll-based navigation

4. INTERACTIVE DEMOS
   - Playable mini-games embedded in the site
   - Character movement in showcase areas
   - Interactive portfolio presentations

Implementation Approaches:

APPROACH 1: Vanilla JavaScript + CSS
------------------------------------
- Pros: No dependencies, full control, lightweight
- Cons: More manual work, need to handle edge cases
- Best for: Simple sprite movement, basic interactions

APPROACH 2: React Hooks (Custom or Library)
--------------------------------------------
- Pros: React-native, reusable, state management
- Cons: Requires React knowledge
- Best for: Component-based movement, React/Next.js projects

APPROACH 3: Canvas API (HTML5)
------------------------------
- Pros: High performance, pixel-level control, game-like feel
- Cons: More complex, requires canvas knowledge
- Best for: Game-like experiences, complex animations

APPROACH 4: Game Engine Libraries
---------------------------------
- Pros: Full game engine features, physics, collision detection
- Cons: Heavier, might be overkill for simple movement
- Best for: Complex interactive experiences, actual mini-games

   Phaser (npm: phaser)
   - Full 2D game framework
   - Perfect for 2D RPG showcase
   - Installation: npm install phaser
   - Note: Heavy, use only if embedding actual game demos


PART 3.5: THREE.JS ANALYSIS - SHOULD YOU USE IT?
================================================================================

WHAT IS THREE.JS?
-----------------
Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser
using WebGL. It's primarily designed for 3D scenes, models, lighting, cameras,
and 3D animations.

SHOULD YOU USE THREE.JS FOR YOUR 2D RPG WEBSITE?
-------------------------------------------------

SHORT ANSWER: Probably NOT for the core WASD movement, but MAYBE for special effects.

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

❌ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:
-----------------------
1. Basic WASD Movement (2D)
   - Three.js is 3D-focused; using it for 2D is like using a sledgehammer to
     crack a nut
   - Overhead: ~500KB+ bundle size just for 3D rendering you won't use
   - Complexity: Steeper learning curve for something simple
   - Performance: Unnecessary GPU usage for 2D movement

2. Simple Character Sprite Movement
   - CSS transforms or Canvas 2D are more appropriate
   - Framer Motion + React hooks will be lighter and easier

3. Standard Website Navigation
   - Traditional approaches are better for accessibility and SEO

✅ CONSIDER THREE.JS IF YOU WANT:
---------------------------------
1. 3D Showcase Elements
   - Rotating 3D models of game characters
   - 3D environment previews
   - Interactive 3D game world exploration
   - 3D logo animations

2. Parallax/Depth Effects
   - 3D parallax scrolling
   - Layered depth effects
   - Camera movements through 3D space

3. Special Interactive Sections
   - 3D portfolio gallery
   - 3D game asset viewer
   - Immersive 3D backgrounds

4. Future-Proofing
   - If you plan to develop 3D games later
   - If you want to showcase 3D capabilities

HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED):
------------------------------
Use the RIGHT tool for each job:

1. WASD Movement (2D): 
   → react-use + framer-motion (lightweight, perfect for 2D)

2. 2D Game Demos:
   → Phaser or Canvas API (designed for 2D games)

3. 3D Showcase Elements (optional):
   → @react-three/fiber + three.js (only where needed)

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
-----------------------
Bundle Size Impact:
- react-use: ~5KB
- framer-motion: ~50KB
- @react-three/fiber + three: ~500KB+

For a 2D RPG website, adding Three.js just for WASD movement would:
- Increase bundle size by ~10x
- Add unnecessary complexity
- Potentially hurt mobile performance
- Not provide any benefits over simpler solutions

RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR PROJECT:
---------------------------------
✅ DO USE:
- react-use + framer-motion for WASD movement
- Canvas API or Phaser if embedding actual 2D game demos

❌ DON'T USE Three.js for:
- Basic WASD character movement
- Simple 2D sprite animations
- Standard website interactions

🤔 CONSIDER Three.js ONLY if:
- You want to add 3D character model viewers
- You plan to showcase 3D game projects
- You want impressive 3D background effects
- You're willing to invest time learning 3D concepts

ALTERNATIVE: Start Simple, Scale Up
------------------------------------
1. Phase 1: Build with react-use + framer-motion (lightweight, fast)
2. Phase 2: Add Phaser if you want embedded 2D game demos
3. Phase 3: Add Three.js ONLY if you need specific 3D features

This approach:
- Keeps initial bundle size small
- Faster development
- Better performance
- Easier to maintain
- You can always add Three.js later if needed

INSTALLATION (if you decide to use it):
----------------------------------------
npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three

Note: @react-three/drei provides helpful utilities and helpers for React Three Fiber

4. CANVAS MANIPULATION (If using Canvas approach)
   -----------------------------------------------
   react-konva (npm: react-konva)
   - React wrapper for Konva.js (2D canvas library)
   - Good for sprite-based movement
   - Installation: npm install react-konva konva

5. UTILITY LIBRARIES
   ------------------
   zustand (npm: zustand)
   - Lightweight state management
   - Useful for managing movement state globally
   - Installation: npm install zustand

   clsx (npm: clsx)
   - Conditional className utility
   - Already commonly used with Tailwind
   - Installation: npm install clsx

Recommended Package Installation Command:
-----------------------------------------
npm install react-use framer-motion zustand clsx

For Canvas-based approach (optional):
npm install react-konva konva

For game engine approach (optional, heavy):
npm install phaser


PART 4: IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Recommended Stack for WASD Movement:

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION:
- react-use (for keyboard handling)
- framer-motion (for smooth animations)
- Custom React hooks for movement logic

Why This Combination:
1. Lightweight and performant
2. React/Next.js native
3. Easy to implement and maintain
4. Smooth animations out of the box
5. Good TypeScript support

Implementation Strategy:

1. Create a custom hook (useWASD.ts):
   - Use react-use's useKeyboard hook
   - Track W, A, S, D key states
   - Return movement direction and velocity
   - Handle key combinations (diagonal movement)

2. Create a Movement Component:
   - Use framer-motion for animated movement
   - Accept position props from WASD hook
   - Smooth transitions between positions
   - Boundary detection (prevent moving off-screen)

3. Integration Points:
   - Character sprite on homepage
   - Interactive game showcase area
   - Navigation alternative to scrolling
   - Portfolio exploration mode

Accessibility Considerations:
- Provide fallback to mouse/touch controls
- Ensure keyboard navigation doesn't interfere with screen readers
- Add toggle to enable/disable WASD movement
- Show visual indicators when WASD mode is active


PART 5: ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS
================================================================================

- Pixel art style (if matching your 2D RPG aesthetic)
- Animated backgrounds
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Particle effects
- Game UI-inspired navigation elements

Performance Considerations:
